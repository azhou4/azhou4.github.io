<h5> Practical Education Network: Teachers Guide  (June 2019)</h5>
<p>Through the <a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/education/classes/d-lab-education-learning">MIT D-Lab: Education and Learning course</a>, I worked closely with <a href="http://www.practicaleducationnetwork.com/">Practical Education Network (PEN)</a>, a nonprofit based in Accra, Ghana that works on implementing hands-on learning approaches in science and math classrooms. 
As a group of three, we dove deep into kinesthetic learning and project learning, and worked with PEN to develop teacher training materials that would aid in their teacher development workshops. In August 2019, I visited Accra for a week; I met with local teachers, toured schools, and learned more about the impact of PEN on local schools. </p>
